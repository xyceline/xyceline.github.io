                <p>01 Revealing the Water <br>
                    Instructor: Echeverri Natalia, Ng Sylvia<br>
                    Date: 2023-24 (Fall)<br><br>
                    Located in Sham Shek Tsuen, an abandoned agricultural village in North
                   Lantau, "Revealing the Water" transforms a singular, linear waterway
                   into a network of meandering streams. Here, the artificial relics dance
                   in harmony with the spontaneous choreography of nature. Through
                   "Revealing the Water", the abandoned orchard is revived, and the revealed
                   water performed scenarios that include an ecological wet island and a
                   set of water routes interacting with sands and fishery relics. The project
                   has turned this quiet, forgotten rural place into a vibrant destination for
                   visitors and locals alike.</p>

                <p>02 Emerging Wetland <br>
                    Instructor: Irene Curulli <br>
                    Date: 2024-25 (During exchange in Virginia Tech)<br><br>
                    As climate change accelerates, rising sea levels around Virginia Beach 
                    pose both a challenge and an opportunity. "Emerging Wetland" embraces 
                    this shift, converting agricultural land near the North Landing River into 
                    a dynamic ecological experience and environmental education center. 
                    A network of meandering boardwalks along the river's edge leads 
                    visitors through various emerging wetland types, marking today's 
                    boundaries and revealing the impact of shifting water levels over time. 
                    Visitors begin in the dry, forested landscape, then journey through a 
                    lakeside picnic area, witnessing the gradual encroachment of water 
                    on farmland until reaching fully developed wetlands. The experience 
                    concludes at an education center, where visitors can learn more about 
                    these transforming ecosystems and their future.</p>

                <p>03 Alternative Boundary <br>
                    Instructor: Trumpf Susanne Elisabeth, Ettel Nikolas <br>
                    Date: 2023-24 (Spring)<br><br>
                    "Alternative Boundary" integrates water within the urban fabric of Tseung 
                    Kwan O, a newly developed reclaimed urban area. My urban strategy includes 
                    two major stripes, the long vertical stripe running through the middle, and the 
                    curved stripe along the periphery. These two stripes are the "breathed" areas 
                    within the city, serving a dual purpose: effectively managing waterlogging 
                    in urban areas by guiding water to the sea, while also creating an enriching 
                    journey for individuals, particularly the community, to traverse from the dense 
                    urban core to the ecological shores. 
                    This innovative approach not only enhances urban life but also exemplifies 
                    the potential of landscape architecture to solve complex urban challenges, 
                    pushing the original rigid boundaries to create “Alternative Boundary” for 
                    people living in a super artificial urban fabric. </p>

                    Instructor: Ashley Scott Kelly <br>
                    Date: 2024-25 (Spring)<br><br>
                    This project examines how two state-led mega-infrastructure projects in northern Thailand—the Yuam 
                    Water Diversion Tunnel and the Transmission Line Project—spatially overlap to transform remote 
                    landscapes and disrupt long-standing community connectivity. By imposing new access roads, these mega
                    infrasturcture projects will significantly increase regional accessibility and shorten travel times between rural 
                    areas and outside world. Yet, in doing so, they profoundly alter existing patterns of land use, ecological 
                    systems, and socio-cultural linkages, particularly within Karen highland communities.  </p>
